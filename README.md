# protocol-webform
form which generates a pdf from the input and upon confirmation of the pdf stores the input to a database as well as sends the pdf via email to the customer

### Configuration:
* import webform_protocol.sql for the database schema
* edit config.ini
* if you wish to use a pdf template, replace the (almost) blank /pdf/template.pdf

***Note: The PDF preview will open in a tab/window. Your browser might suppress it, if configured that way.***
